## Creating Memories

![Create Memory](screenshots/mobile-screenshot-create-new-memory.png)

To add a new memory:

1. **Click "Create Memory"** button on the main page
2. **Memory Content**: Describe what happened in natural language
3. **Date**: Set when the memory occurred (defaults to today)
4. **URL (optional)**: Add links to related content, photos, or documents
5. **Tags**: The app suggests relevant tags from your existing tag library (plus feeling suggestions), or create your own

**Customizable Tagging System**: Create your own tag categories to organize memories your way:

-   `person:john` for people in your life
-   `place:Trader Joes` for locations and experiences
-   `feeling:excited` for emotions and moods
-   `project:InstaMem` for work and personal projects
-   `genre:jazz` for music, books, or entertainment
-   `skill:programming` for learning and development

Type and press space/comma to create new tags. The system learns your patterns and suggests relevant tags.

**Smart Feeling Tags**: When adding emotion tags, InstaMem provides helpful definitions to help you choose the most accurate feeling. For example, you'll see distinctions between "excited" (enthusiastic anticipation) vs "elated" (extremely happy) vs "euphoric" (intense excitement).

## Editing Memories

When editing a memory:

1. **Modify content**: Update the memory description
2. **Change date**: Adjust when the memory occurred
3. **Update URL**: Add or modify associated links
4. **Smart tag suggestions**: As you type, InstaMem suggests relevant tags based on your existing tag library
5. **Feeling definitions**: The dropdown shows different emotions with helpful descriptions to choose the most accurate feeling

**Example feeling suggestions with definitions:**

-   `feeling: accomplished` - "Pleased and satisfied"
-   `feeling: proud` - "Feeling satisfaction in achievements"
-   `feeling: affectionate` - "Showing fondness and care"
-   `feeling: disaffected` - "Dissatisfied and rebellious"

The tag suggestion system learns from your previous entries and helps maintain consistency while the definitions ensure you pick the most precise emotional tags.

## Tips for Effective Use

### Memory Creation Best Practices

1. **Be descriptive**: Include context, people, and feelings
2. **Add URLs**: Link to photos, documents, or related content
3. **Use consistent naming**: Keep person/place names consistent for better search
4. **Include emotions**: Tag how you felt - it makes memories more searchable

### Search Tips

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with general terms, then add specifics
2. **Use tag categories**: Search "person:john" to find all memories with John
3. **Try variations**: If exact spelling doesn't work, the fuzzy search will help
4. **Combine terms**: Mix people, places, and feelings for precise results

### Organization Strategies

1. **Regular entry**: Add memories daily while details are fresh
2. **Consistent tagging**: Use similar tag patterns for related memories
3. **Date accuracy**: Correct dates help with chronological search
