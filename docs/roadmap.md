## TODO

Stuff that needs to be addressed or fleshed out

-   "resum" search term has a result that does not contain "resum" - need a debug mode or tool to explain why. Ideally CLI memories search uses same code as browser, but with debug flag option to explain non exact matches.
-   IMPROVEMENT: should sync before and after every edit or create memory.
-   IMPROVEMENT: browser warning: A form field element should have an id or name attribute (violator is input for tags, label for tags also should be fixed, see TagInput)
-   BUG: (COMPLEX, DO LATER) Switching from online to offline on main page works, can continue to search. If in create/edit page, and go to offline, going back to homepage to search does not work, just shows blank page (/ or /login are both blank)
-   IMPROVEMENT: search results sorting - need to document. Most recently updated first?  Maybe create sort link that shows sort options: newest|oldest|updated|best 
-   IMPROVEMENT: on search results, click on tag to do a search on that tag
-   BUG: "feeling:excited" search does not match memories with tag "feeling:excited"  but should.
